4) {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs 
        {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX.
=>   The Difference is stated below:

    {TitleComponent}: This value describes the TitleComponent as a javascript 
                        expression or a variable. The {} can embed a javascript 
                        expression or a variable inside it.

    {<TitleComponent/>} : This value represents a Component that is basically 
                            returning Some JSX value. In simple terms 
                            TitleComponent a function that is returning a JSX value. 
                            A component is written inside the {<  />} expression.

    {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} : <TitleComponent /> and 
                                        <TitleComponent></TitleComponent> are 
                                        equivalent only when < TitleComponent /> has 
                                        no child components. The opening and closing
                                        tags are created to include the child 
                                        components.
        Example
        <TitleComponent>
            <FirstChildComponent />
            <SecondChildComponent />
            <ThirdChildComponent />
        </TitleComponent>
