1) What is the difference between Named export, Default export, and * as export?
=>  Import and export's have been introduced to js in ES6. It provides 2 ways to
    export a module from a file default and named.

    Named export: You can have multiple of 'em. In import you have to wrap the content
    inside {}. The import and export names should match.

    Default export: You can have only 1. No need to wrap inside any brackets. No 
    need for import and export names to match either.

    * export: Used when there are multiple exports and when import with * they are 
    wrapped inside an object 

            import * as objectName from "path";

2)  What is the importance of config.js file?
=>  config file is used to keep all the hardcoded data which increses the 
    readability.

3)  What are React Hooks?
=>  React hooks are normal utility js functions which provide some special functions
    like useState() provides local state variables which can keep up with 
    state changes.

4)  Why do we need useState Hook?
=>  When value of local variables change react doesn't know that variable has
    changed its value and hence it doesn't re-render but in-case of useState it 
    keeps a track of state of the variable and hence it re-renders when the state 
    of the variable changes.
