1)  What is Microservice?
=>  Microservice architecture is a way of software development wherein 
    tasks/domains(such as UI, backend, db's) are built & worked upon independently 
    and connected through API's. This type of architecture helps deliver software 
    fast and also working with them is also quite easy.

2)  What is Monolith architecture?
=>  In Monolith architecture the whole software is built as a unit with one codebase.
    To make a change in software in these type of we basically have to modify the 
    whole codebase then build and deploy again this results in time delays in 
    delivery.
    
3)  What is the difference between Monolith and Microservice?
=>  Monolith architecture: It is built to work as a single unit and hence if any
    spike in demand will have to scale the whole project and as the codebase grows 
    it becomes very hard to maintain and scale them.

    Microservice architecture:  Here each unit is treated and worked seperately so 
    any spike in demand you could only scale that particular part of project and
    hence maintaining one is easy.

4)  Why do we need a useEffect Hook?
=>  Whenever we want some initial render and after we recieve data from API we want
    render again i.e. whenever we want a function to run after the component is 
    rendered we use useEffect Hook.

5)  What is Optional Chaining?
=>  Optional Chaining(?.) operator helps in calling property of the object. If incase 
    the property that you are trying to access is null or undefined then instead of
    throwing error it returns undefined, this really helps in preventing your app
    from crashing.

6)  What is Shimmer UI?
=>  Shimmer UI is the latest practice in the market wherein before the actual render
    of UI some basic template of UI is rendered which betters the user experience.

7)  What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement?
=>  JS expression returns some value.
    ex: *) 1 + 3; // returns 4
        *) console.log("Hi"); // logs "Hi"
        *) str.toLowerCase(); // returns lowerCase

    JS statement doesnot return anything.
    ex: *) let a;
        *) if() {};

    JS expression in JSX: {JS expression}
    JS statement in JSX: {(JS statement)}

8)  What is Conditional Rendering? explain with a code example.
=>  Rendering a component based on some condition.

    if(restaurantList.length === 0)
        return <Shimmer /> 
    
9)  What is CORS?
=>  Cross Origin Resourse Sharing(CORS) is a HTTP based resourse sharing mechanism 
    which defines policy for diffrent resourses of diffrent domain, port or header 
    to communicate with each other.

10) What is async and await?
=>  async/await is a syntactic sugar for writting promises.

    The keyword async says that our function is an async function.
    The keyword await says to until that particular line(promise) is executed(settled).

11) What is the use of const json = await data.json(); in getRestaurants()?
=>  the data object has the data from API and which is usually not in readable form
    which is converted into json using data.json() method which returns a promise 
    hence the await keyword is attached to it.
