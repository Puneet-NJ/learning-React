=>  *)One way to add images into your project is directly importing it from web.

2)  What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
=>  If we do console.log(useState()), we get an array [undefined, function] 
    where first item in an array is state is undefined and the second item in
    an array is setState function is bound dispatchSetState.

3)  How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array?
=>  Syntax of useEffect is:

    useEffect(() => {}, []);
    Case 1 : When the dependency array is not included in the arguments of useEffect() hook, the callback function will be executed every time the component is rendered and re-rendered.

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("I run everytime this component rerenders")
    });
    Case 2 : When the dependency array is empty in the arguments of useEffect() hook, the callback function will be executed only one time during the initial render of the component.

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("I Only run once (When the component gets mounted)")
    }, []);
    Case 3 : When the dependency array contains a condition, the callback function will be executed one time during the initial render of the component and also rerender if there is a change in the condition.

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("I run every-time when my condition changed")
    }, [condition]);

4)  What is SPA?
=>  Single Page Application is the website which loads data without reloading.

5)  What is the difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
=>  In Server side routing whenever there is change in the URL a http request is
    made to load a new page, which takes sometime.

    In Client side routing whenever there is a change in the URL only the components 
    get exchanged, hence it saves alot of time. All Single Page Applications 
    uses client-side routing.
