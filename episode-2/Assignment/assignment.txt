1)   What is NPM?
=>  NPM is a package manager when you want to have packages in your project that 
    is when you need a package manager.

2) What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do you need it?
=>  Parcel/Webpack is Bundler that is they make your code production ready(i.e. make 
    your code run faster) by eliminating multiple time consuming tasks such as console.logs, comments, 
    extra spaces and others.

3) What is '.parcel-cache'?
=>  It saves the previous changes made to your code and make it run faster by only 
    making changes on the changed code this is the reason why each time you execute 
    your production code it executes comparetively faster each time.

4) What is 'npx'?
=>  "npx" is a command to execute packages using npm.
    ex: npx parcel index.html

5) What is diffrence bw 'dependencies' & 'devDependencies'?
=>  devDependencies are used only during development environment but 
    normal dependencies are used during production or testing environment.

6) What is Tree shaking?
=>  It is a technique used while writing an optimzed code which removes all the 
    unused code.

7) What is HMR?
=>  Bundler such as Parcel automatically rebuilds your app after a change in the 
    code(known as hot reloading) but in some cases it performs HMR. HMR improves DX 
    by updating the module automatically without the need of reloading the page 
    and can also retain the state of the app.

8) List down your favorite 5 superpowers of Parcel and 
    describe any 3 of them in your own words. 
=>  Features of Parcel are:

        * Tree Shaking: Removing unused code.
        * HMR: rebuilding app without the need of manual reloading.
        * Caching while development: parcel-cache file maintains cache 
                                        which reduces the build time.
        * Image optimization
        * Code minification: minifies the code

9) What is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it?
=> gitignore file contains the files which shouldn't go into the version control 
    systems.

    All the files which could be regenerated shouldn't go into the version control 
    hence should be put in .gitignore file such as node_modules, parcel-cache & dist.

10) What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
=>  package.json holds the approximate version of the dependencies with ^ or ~ sign
    but package-lock.json holds the exact version of the dependency and locks it
    also contains some other details of the dependency.

11) Why should I not modify package-lock.json?
=>  package-lock.json has the details regarding all the dependencies and 
    there versions deleting it may cause dependencies issues in production environment.

12) What is node_modules ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
=>  node_modules are the dependencies installed from npm and it contains all the
    other dependencies which the current dependency is dependent on.

        node_modules could be regenerated from package.json & package-lock.json
    so no need to put it on to git.

13) What is the dist folder?
=>  dist folder contains the minified production code.

14) What is browserslist?
=> It is a package used to manage the availability of your app in diffrent browsers.
